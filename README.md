This project presents a machine learning and deep learning classifier for handwriting analysis, focusing on the letter "t" as a personality indicator. Using CNN models, machine learning, and OpenCV, the system extracts features like size, slant, pressure, and spacing to classify 19 traits, achieving over 95% accuracy.
